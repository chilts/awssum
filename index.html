      <h2>GreenQloud</h2>
      <p>
        GreenQloud released their new management console in early September 2012, using Meteor and AwsSum! Not only are
        they using AwsSum to talk to a cloud - it's their own cloud. What better than the cloud providers using it
        themselves to talk to their own services?

      <h2>Medium.com</h2>
      <p>
        When Medium launched in mid-August 2012, they turned to AwsSum to help them in their deploy process, which
        involved talking to EC2, S3 and Route53. Deploying large numbers of server for large numbers of visitors is
        something that AwsSum just laps up.
